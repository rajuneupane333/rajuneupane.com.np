    <h1>My Dearest Garima,</h1>

    <p>It's been quite a journey, hasn't it? From our very first chat on May 20th to where we are today, October 19th, my life has been transformed in the most incredible way.</p>

    <p>We might not have met in person yet, but it's as if our hearts have always known each other. Your love has touched my soul, and I want you to know that my love for you is just as deep and real.</p>

    <p>I truly believe that we're meant to be together. Our connection is so rare and beautiful, and every moment we've shared has made it more precious. I can't imagine my life without you now; you've become an integral part of who I am.</p>

    <p>Our journey from Messenger to WhatsApp, and through all those moments of frustration, has only made us stronger. I call you "Sanu" and "Puntu" not just as nicknames but as expressions of the love we share. They remind me of all the laughter and joy you've brought into my life.</p>

    <p>Garima, I can't wait to meet you, to hold you close and make all our dreams come true. I can see a future with you, a life filled with happiness and love.</p>

    <p>You mean the world to me, and I can't wait to say "I do" and make you mine forever. Until that day, please know that you're always on my mind, and my heart is yours.</p>

    <p>With all my love, <br>Messi</p>
